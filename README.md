### Colour Palette 
The project's colour palette is straightforward. Due to the potential for several colours in food-related photographs, the UI may become confusing. The colour palette was generated by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

| When deploying the project to Heroku, I got an error when viewing the uploaded site. | Disallowed Host | In settings.py, I changed the value of ALLOWED_HOSTS to my right Heroku project URL. 
| When liking a recipe, I got brought to the ERROR 405 page instead of being redirected to the recipe_detail page. | ERROR 405 | I made a mistake in the RecipeLike view. Although I named my variable post, the correct name was the recipe.  
| When I wanted to create a draft recipe I was getting a 404 error. | ERROR 404 | The RecipeDetail view was only filtering through published recipes, not drafts. I added an extra filter for draft recipes.
