## UX

### Project Description

Fitness Meals is an application that lets users share healthy recipes. Registered users can create and share recipes and engage with other members by liking and commenting on their recipes. Unregistered users will only be able to view recipes but need to register to use the full features of the application. Fitness Meals is built with the Django Python framework using the Agile methodology to plan the project.

### Project Goals

1. Create a user-friendly application with a visually pleasing design
2. Make sure the website is fully responsive to fit all screen sizes
3. View a list of member's shared recipes on a pagination pages
4. Implement user registration and login so authentic users can create and share their recipes and also like and comment on other member's recipes
5. Deploy the application making sure the site has excellent performance and accessibility

### User Stories

- As a User, I can view the home page so that I can learn about the application
- As a User, I can register an account so that I can create and share my recipes
- As a User, I can log in so that I can use the application's full functionality
- As a user, I can log out so that I can keep my account secure
- As a User, I can create a new recipe so that I can share it with other users
- As a User, I can edit recipes so that I can change recipe details
- As a User, I can delete my recipes so that I can remove the recipe from the application
- As a User, I can view a list of shared recipes so that I can get inspiration from other user's recipes
- As a User, I can view the recipe so that I can see the recipe's full details
- As a User, I can comment on members' recipes so that I ask questions about the recipe
- As a User, I can like or unlike recipes so that I can support the other users
- As a User, I can see my profile page so that I can see my recipes

### Agile Methodology 
My project was planned using the Agile Methodology, and you can find my project board [Here](https://github.com/users/EdwardShanahan07/projects/7/views/1). A Github Issue was opened for each feature. Each issue was given a label, an epic, a user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks. I discovered that planning and organising my project was made simpler by the Agile Methodology.

### Colour Palette 
The project's colour palette is straightforward. Due to the potential for several colours in food-related photographs, the UI may become confusing. The colour palette was generated by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When deploying the project to Heroku, I got an error when viewing the uploaded site. | Disallowed Host | In settings.py, I changed the value of ALLOWED_HOSTS to my right Heroku project URL. 
| When liking a recipe, I got brought to the ERROR 405 page instead of being redirected to the recipe_detail page. | ERROR 405 | I made a mistake in the RecipeLike view. Although I named my variable post, the correct name was the recipe.  
| When I wanted to create a draft recipe I was getting a 404 error. | ERROR 404 | The RecipeDetail view was only filtering through published recipes, not drafts. I added an extra filter for draft recipes.
